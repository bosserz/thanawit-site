                    My name is Thanawit Suwannikom, but most people know me as Boss. I hold a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in Chemical Engineering, both of which have equipped me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and project management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my formal education, I've also developed expertise in computer science and data science through self-study. I've taken numerous online courses and read extensively on topics such as statistics, programming, machine learning, and data visualization. Through this self-directed learning, I've gained practical skills and knowledge that have allowed me to excel as a lead data scientist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a skilled and experienced data scientist with a diverse educational background, I bring a unique perspective to every project I work on. I enjoy working with cross-functional teams to develop innovative solutions that solve complex business problems. I'm a clear communicator and a strategic thinker, always looking for ways to improve processes and deliver results that exceed expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy staying active and pursuing my interests in technology and entrepreneurship. I'm a lifelong learner and enjoy reading and staying up-to-date on the latest developments in data science and related fields. Whether I'm at work or at play, I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself and grow both personally and professionally.
